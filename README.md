## Colabs

- [x] [Colab 0](./CS224W_Colab_0.ipynb)
- [x] [Colab 1](./CS224W_Colab_1.ipynb)
- [x] [Colab 2](./CS224W_Colab_2.ipynb)
- [x] [Colab 3](./CS224W_Colab_3.ipynb)
- [x] [Colab 4](./CS224W_Colab_4.ipynb)
- [x] [Colab 5](./CS224W_Colab_5.ipynb)

## Highlights

- Message passing in GraphML. *I think it is the most important conception in GNN. The ppts are very intuitive and concise which are quite worth reading*
- PyG. *In the Colabs, we will use this package quite often, not only at high-level but also at low-level. To finish the Colabs, you usually need to check the docs, which make you familiar with PyG*
- GCN/GAT/GraphSAGE *We will implement these models in the Colabs*
- PageRank, Knowledge graph, etc. *This course covers many topics in GNN.*
